The current list of tasks, bugs, and notes for the InorganicBuilderPlugin that I have come up with is below.

><< Build Device SubMenu >><

- Cannot use both inclusions and exclusions together, although the user can try.
The result is either that all objects are included or excluded, depending what was selected last.

><< Build Surface Structures SubMenu >><

Bugs:
- There are 3 fields for added structures: the array position, the struct name, and the structure-type.
  When an added structure is removed, the struct name repeats upon the next structure add.
  However, the array position is fine and has no repetitions. Thus, this is only a visual/cosmetic issue.

- <<Add Structure SubSubMenu >> Atom Type Selections does nothing, I believe. It is just a visual entry.

- <<Add Structure SubSubMenu >> DNA residues are messed up sometimes.
  Happens for both single/double strand (if enough strands are built, the error is encountered).
  PEG does not have this problem at all.

  Some segnames for DNA that is being built have incorrect residue chains.
  Normally, the chain should be a list of consecutive integers (i.e. 599, 600, 601...629)

  However, these messed up chains are seemingly skipping values (i.e. 918, 919, 933, 
  934, 935,...944) note that 920-932 are skipped and then it is consecutive again.

- <<NAMD SubSubMenu>> "Add Ions" button should be disabled if the system has not been solvated yet.

- <<NAMD SubSubMenu>> Solvating a Hex Box produces a good PDB, but a bad PSF.
  The molecules are moved so re-using the old PSF does not make sense (re-using is what is being done).
  
- <<NAMD SubSubMenu >> AutoSolvate fills water molecules inside of hollow shapes.
  
- Drawing the surface for molecules that have bonds causes a graphical discrepancy. The bonds stop being drawn.
  i.e. after hitting the "Draw Surface Atoms" button for a gold surface with a PEG attached.
  PEG will not have the bonds drawn visually, but otherwise everything is fine.
  
Future Implementation:
- Allow building across both DNA and PEG in one build.
  This is currently doable by 1.) Building exclusively with one type, then 2.) Resetting the device and 
  3.) loading in the built system as the loaded molecule followed by 4.) building exclusively with the other type.
  
- Re-Open the Custom Structure Menu once it is functional, right now only PEG and DNA menus are shown.

- Setup NAMD to work with NanoHub resources in order to access the remote clusters they have available.

- Overlap detection
-> Using overlap detection to predict which direction the attachment should be "flipped".

- Periodic Rhomboids in addition to current Hex, Square modes.

- Platform testing Linux/Windows/OSX


Non-critical Upgrades:

- Increase the number of segment names available for structures when they are building.
  In case of super large systems being built.
  
- Add DX file scaling for uploaded DX file exclusions

- Estimate vertice selection rate in order to speed up the process even more.
