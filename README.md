InorganicBuilderPlugin

Using molecular dynamic simulation - explore the interactions between a molecular structure and substrate when they are linked together.

This tool is designed to serve as an interactive method of exploring graphical simulation of environments characterized by a molecular structure attached to a substrate through an anchoring development. 

Install the latest version in the VMD plugin directory by copying this repo's contents into ".../VMD/plugins/noarch/tcl/inorganicbuilder0.1/" 

The code for Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) and Molecular Dynamics (NAMD) was developed by the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group at the University of Illinois.
